      <h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
      <p>Shopping carts are essential to today’s web design, when designing a platform that sells something. Shopping carts are usually pre-designed and pre-programmed utilities that we can use on our web pages.</p>

      <p>Moreover, it’s also useful platforms because of how they connect the designers, owners of the website and the customer. It’s easy to follow transactions, it can store customer information and product information, and many more things.</p>

      <p>There are many options to choose from when it comes to shopping carts, and they are often boiled down to two different paths. Either a company or an invidivual can go through a third party, and let someone else “host” your solution. This is fast and easy for the company/individual, but not direct when it comes to changes or upkeep on functionality. It’s sometimes unpractical to go through a third party when it comes to service or changes.</p>

      <p>The other option is to build your own program, and customize it to your specific needs. You have way better options in how you want the shopping cart to look like. As with any other project on the internet, this requires a bit more expertise. You have to know how to code or hire someone that knows how to code a program that can do this. It’s YOUR responsibility when it comes to technical issues and problems.</p>

      <p>Therefor hosted solutions are way more often recommended for beginners and people whit smaller businesses - but if you know how to, you should do it yourself and put time into it. </p>

      <aside id="aside">“Definition: A shopping cart on an online retailer's site is a piece of software that facilitates the purchase of a product or service. It accepts the customer's payment and organizes the distribution of that information to the merchant, payment processor and other parties.”</aside>
