    <td class="text1">Customers:<br>From age 21 and up (hopefully..). Most used platform is probably a smaller device (handheld). There are beer lovers, who has the economy to drink more expensive locally produced beer, who maybe need to look up info about Chris' beer while they are in a bar. Semi professional experience in web usage.</td>
    <td class="text1">Customers "need" (hopefully not all are alcoholics), a good tasting beer that they know comes from a small scale batch, geographically close to them and in a unique way. They know what a good tasting beer is, and wants to know more about this one in particular - their concern i.d. if it appeals to them.</td>
    <td class="text1">* How to and where to buy the beer ("shopping cart". Probably will end up being a "contact to buy" kind of page for now.<br>* Information about which beers Chris brews (what kind of hops, how it is brewed etc. etc. Here I'm also going to design logos for the future beers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="text1">Other brewers:<br>Also hopefully from age 21 and up. Most used platform is more business-ish (computer, or larger device). They have the same ideas and values as Chris, and might look something up from his website because they want to ask him questions about business, or other inquiries. </td>
    <td class="text1">Other brewers also have some kind of business to run. They want to know if Chris would be a possible collaborator, or if he is a competitor. </td>
    <td class="text1">* Contact page (for business inquiries).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="text1">Bars:<br>Also from age 21 and up (Im Swedish, and im uncertain if you can own a bar if you're under 21 here?). Most used platform is definitely a computer or larger screen. They are searching for a new beer in their bar, and it all comes strictly down to business. Good computer skills, and know what they are looking for on a brewer's website.</td>
    <td class="text1">Bars need information, kind of similar to the customer. They have more economy in mind though because they are a serious business. They want to know if it sells, taste good and if Chris can deliver on time and in quantities.</td>
    <td class="text1">* Contact page (for business inquiries)<br>* Another, more professional business page, with info about what kind of business Chris runs.</td>
