               <p class="page-content1-par">As I travel this journey for the perfect beer I want to be able to show off some of the tasty craft brews I have been able to create along the way.</p>

               <p class="page-content1-par">My journey started in a Seattle Hop Shop. A well known shop that held weekly classes and provided me with some of the best hops and grains available in the area. After a couple years of brewing, I began to experiment with my own recipes, looking to make the perfect craft beer that I would be proud to share with friends family and now you.</p>

               <p class="page-content1-par">As I work towards my goal of becoming a well known brewer I am hoping that this site will bring attention to the craft I am proud of. Showing off my creations will keep me inspired to continue. Continue to make one of the best beverages loved around the globe!</p>
